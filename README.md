# Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains my projects for Reinforcement Learning (CSCI181V).

## Projects

- **Q-Learning**: Model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to find the best action to take given the current state. It does this by learning a Q-value function that estimates the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state.
  - **Qtable**: A table that stores Q-values for each state-action pair.
  - **Qnetwork**: A neural network that approximates the Q-value function.
  - **QNN with buffer**: A Q-network with experience replay buffer to store and reuse past experiences.
  - **DQN**: Deep Q-Network that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function.
